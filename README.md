> **Procedural Maze Generator with Pathfinding**  
> Unity (C#) project focused on **Procedural Generation** and **AI Pathfinding**.  
> Developed as a **technical portfolio project**, emphasizing clean architecture, clarity, and good programming practices.

---

## 🎮 Overview
This project generates a **procedural maze** at runtime and computes the **optimal path** between a start and end point using classic **pathfinding algorithms** applied to a grid-based system.  
The maze generation supports **custom or random seeds**, allowing deterministic or varied results.
